## Colour usage

- Page ground `surface-100`; raised sections and cards `surface-200`; wells `surface-300`.
- Dark bands use `night` with `on-night` / `on-night-muted` text: nav, hero, privacy, footer, the middle platform pillar.
- `brand` (green) for primary actions, links, ticks and figures on light grounds.
- `signal` (lime) as a fill only, with `on-signal` text: hero CTA, nav CTA, final CTA panel, privacy icon tiles, logo dot. Never lime text on light grounds.

## Sections (top to bottom)

1. **Nav** (sticky, `night`): 80px tall desktop, 64px mobile; shrinks to 64/56px after 40px scroll. Logo left, 5 links (desktop), right: Log in (ghost), Create merchant (signal). Mobile: Log in + menu button (44px), full-height menu panel.
2. **Hero** (`night`): centred on desktop, left-aligned on mobile. Headline (accent phrase in `signal`), one-line sub, Create merchant (signal, lg). Padding 128/128 desktop, 72/72 mobile.
3. **Supported assets** (`surface-200`, bottom border): eyebrow + marquee of AssetPills, edge fade mask.
4. **Platform**: header with aside paragraph; 3 pillars (middle one dark), each with number, title, body, three ticks.
5. **Exchange** (`surface-200`, top and bottom borders): text column (eyebrow, h2, lead, four ticks, Request a quote + See supported pairs) and the Rate calculator (max 460px).
6. **Privacy** (`night`): header with aside; four cards (`night-raised`, `line-night` border) with lime icon tile.
7. **What you get**: six feature cards, 3 columns desktop, 2 at `sm`, 1 on mobile.
8. **Getting started** (`surface-200`): "Approved fast. Live the same day." Three steps in a row with a green progress line that fills on reveal.
9. **Developers**: 5/7 split; text + two buttons left, four API capability cards right.
10. **Use cases** (`surface-200`): four link columns over a top rule.
11. **Final CTA**: lime panel (radius xl), headline + line, Create merchant (night fill).
12. **Footer** (`night`): logo + blurb, four link columns, legal line and disclosure.

## Responsive rules

- Everything stacks to one column under `lg`, except feature and privacy cards (2 columns from `sm`).
- CTA pairs stack full-width on mobile.
- No horizontal scroll at 360px. The calculator figures drop to 26px under `sm`.
- Touch targets at least 44px.
