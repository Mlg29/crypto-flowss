**Developers**: API reference link; sandbox access; authentication; webhook events and signing; idempotency and rate limits; SDKs; status page.

**Use cases**: three to five target segments, each with problem, solution, products used and flow; proof such as pilots or case studies, with permission.

## Voice rules (from the brand book)

- Direct and specific: say what happens to the money.
- Sentence case for headlines and buttons. Tickers uppercase.
- Always show unit and network for amounts ("250.00 USDT on Tron").
- No emoji, no hype words, no em dashes.
- Trust copy names the control rather than claiming "bank-grade security".
